    <p>Upload an image! If the image is already Black and White Posterized, that should be detected automatically. If not, please just upload the original version of your color photo instead.
        <br>You can click on "Upload File" at any point to restart the process.
        <br>If you run into any issues/bugs, feel free to just refresh the page and try again.
        <br>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the image you upload is high resolution (like >1k by 1k pixels) the generation might take some time, just be patient.

    <p>Interesting Note: There is some weirdness going on with the physics of color averaging which might account for some of the images looking funky.
        <br>I tried to compensate my code for it in some areas but I don't know if I covered everything. Here is a great youtube video explaining this phenomenon</p>
