    <p>Upload an image! If the image is already Black and White Posterized, that'll be detected automatically.
        Also you can click on "Upload File" at any point to restart the process, but might be buggy.
        If you run into any issues/bugs, feel free to just refresh the page and try again.
        The main work flow should be fine, but if you go back and forth between steps you might uncover a bug.
        IMPORTANT NOTE: If the image you upload is high resolution (like >1k by 1k pixels) the generation might take some time, just be patient.

    <p>Interesting Note: There is some weirdness going on with the physics of color averaging which might account for some of the images looking funky. I tried to compensate my code for it in some areas but I don't know if I covered everything. Here is a great youtube video explaining this phenomenon</p>
